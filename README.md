## Cheddar for Android

This is a universal Android app for [Cheddar](http://cheddarapp.com), a simple task manager.

## Getting started

Get the latest source 
  
  * $git clone https://github.com/aliHafizji/Cheddar-Android.git
  * Import the project in eclipse.
  * Build and Run

The project depends on some external libraries. Since I haven't added any ant build scripts you need to download them manually and add them in your workspace. (I promise to make this better)

  * [Android-PullToRefresh](https://github.com/chrisbanes/Android-PullToRefresh)
  * [Android-DragAndDropListView](https://github.com/bauerca/drag-sort-listview)

## Why isn't this in the Android market?

Although the app is functional there is still a lot of work that needs to be done, such as:

  * Support Android versions below Honeycomb (This will require a lot of changes to the design and styles)
  * Get the realtime API working (The only reason why this is not included is that I don't like any of the current Android libraries for [Pusher](http://pusher.com/docs/client_libraries#android-java). So first I need to make one)

There are lot of other things that need to be done which I will include in the project tracker. Once these are over the app will be available on the market.
